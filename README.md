# CS-267-Final-Project
Alpa is a system for training large-scale neural networks which automates model parallel training of large
deep learning (DL) models by generating execution plans that unify data, operator, and pipeline parallelism.
Currently, Alpa only targets deep learning models such as Transformers and Resnet. For our project, we want to
extend Alpa to support other neural network architectures such as NeRF, AlphaFold, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), and Dynamic Neural Networks. In doing so, we hope to be able to add to Alpa by giving users a more
comprehensive range of capabilities in terms of model parallelism.
